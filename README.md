# IMPORTANT

1. The components folder contains all the components to be used.
2. Create a new folder for any new component.
3. The folder name should be the same as the component name.
4. The folder should contain all the css and js required.
5. No separate css and js files/folder should be created except the component folder.
6. Any asset/image/svg/video/audio should be strictly in the assets folder.

### Remember to pull everytime before you start working on a new component or commiting new code.
